# Video-Based Behavioral Proxy Extraction for Group-Housed Poultry

## Abstract
This project presents a prototype computer vision framework for extracting
movement and spatial interaction proxies from RGB video recordings of
group-housed poultry. Using object detection and multi-object tracking,
the system generates relative movement and crowding indicators that can
support behavioral analysis and precision livestock research. The work
emphasizes interpretability, scalability, and clear acknowledgment of
methodological limitations.

## Motivation
Manual observation of poultry behavior is labor-intensive and difficult
to scale in commercial environments. Automated video-based analysis offers
a non-invasive alternative, but raw video must be converted into structured
behavioral signals. This project explores whether simple and interpretable
computer vision techniques can extract meaningful behavioral proxies from
low-cost RGB video data.

## System Overview
- RGB video input from fixed cameras
- Bird detection using a pretrained object detection model
- Frame-to-frame association via IoU-based tracking
- Trajectory-based feature extraction
- Computation of group-level behavioral proxies

## Extracted Behavioral Proxies

### Relative Movement Index (RMI)
A normalized measure of centroid displacement aggregated across tracked
birds and frames. Intended for comparative analysis between video segments,
not absolute activity measurement.

### High-Density Interaction Events (HDIE)
Counts close-proximity interactions between birds based on spatial distance
thresholds. Used as a proxy for crowding and spatial pressure, not aggression.


## Assumptions and Limitations
- Fixed camera perspective
- 2D RGB video only (no depth information)
- Identity switches under occlusion
- Proxy class used for bird detection
- Metrics are relative indicators, not clinical measures


## Technologies
- PyTorch, YOLOv8
- OpenCV
- Django REST Framework
- NumPy
- React (for result visualization)

## Future Work
- Species-specific fine-tuning on poultry datasets
- Pose-based gait and lameness indicators
- Integration with environmental sensors
- Real-time deployment and edge inference
